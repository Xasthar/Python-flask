<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his
  travels in The Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he
  knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed
  that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves
  from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an
  unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business,
  welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the
      Mountain King, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and
      Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was
      best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost
      Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an
      alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.

      Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and
      apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as

      companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
      joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
      come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother
      Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He
      fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in
      the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of
      Thorin.

    <h3 class="featurette-heading">Glóin</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar,
      the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and
      his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the
      Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely
      Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was
      noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin,
      was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made
      camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. After the
      battle, he returned to the Lonely Mountain.

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the
      dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those
      driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
      Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in
      the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of
      Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
      Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the
      Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

    <p class="lead">
      Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor,
      Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain
      the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern
      Ered Luin. Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a
      few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor.
      The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin
      was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the
      eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their
      leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

      Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years.
      In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled
      with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest
      for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he
      and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five
      Armies, which he survived.

      Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of

      of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced
      to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following
      Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued

      Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his
      family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly
      about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more
      interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

      Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of
      Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the
      Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
      between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest
      of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured,
      Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born
      in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior
      to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside
      Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

    <h3>Gandalf</h3>
    <p>
      Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar
      (with the possible exception of Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before
      the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the
      Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth", he became one of the Maiar
      who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He was associated with
      light and fire, much like his peer Varda. Yet his ways often took him
      to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but
      he walked unseen among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an Elf, and
      sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout
      his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, he took pity on the
      sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drove those who listened to him
      out of despair.
